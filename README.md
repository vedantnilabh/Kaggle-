# Kaggle-
This is a collection of various kaggle competitions I've done with notebooks in the repo as well as estended descriptions of each files and accompnaying links 
to the public kernels. 

Titanic Deep Learning Classifier - used nlp and other methods for feature engineering and implemented a deep neural network classifier with dropout 
to make predictions pertaining to survival while controlling for overfitting. 
I also implemented gridsearch to optimize hyperparameters for the model, which automatically uses cross validation to ensure good performance. 
Accuracy achieved on hidden test data: 0.78468
